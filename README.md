<h2>Purpose üìä</h2>
<p>To create a portfolio that showcases the projects I have undertaken and demonstrates my skills in the field of Data Science.</p>
<h2>Featured Projects</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>1) Fraud Detection</h3>
    <p>
      <li>In this project, I developed a fraud detection system using Machine Learning techniques. I applied classification and clustering algorithms to identify suspicious patterns in the transactional data of an e-commerce company.</li>
      <li>The system proved to be effective in detecting fraud, contributing to the security and reliability of transactions.</li>

    <h3>2) Identifying High-Value Plays in Soccer</h3>
    <p>
      <li>In this project, I conducted an analysis of football plays using Data Science techniques. I used heatmaps to analyze passes and defensive actions at specific coordinates on the field, identifying gameplay patterns.</li>
      <li>I generated pass networks to identify a team's playing circuits and developed a model to predict expected goals using variables such as shot location, angle, and body part used.</li>
      <li>The results were evaluated against a reference model and achieved similar values.</li>
   </p>
  </li>
  <h3>3) Purchase Prediction in Response to Marketing Campaigns. Consumer Income Prediction.</h3>
   </p>
  </li>
  <h3>4) Customer Segmentation of Smart Watches using KMeans and HDBSCAN.</h3>
   </p>
  </li>
  <h3>5) Water Potability Prediction and App Creation using FastAPI.</h3>
   </p>
  </li>
  <h3>6) Flight Satisfaction Prediction and App Creation using Gradio.</h3>
    <p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Future Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continue learning and applying advanced Data Science techniques in challenging projects. Contribute to the development of analytical solutions that enable data-driven decision-making. Collaborate in multidisciplinary teams and contribute value through data analysis.</li>
  <li>I am seeking professional opportunities that allow me to further grow in the field of Data Science and contribute my expertise to innovative projects.</li>
